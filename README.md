# Thronglets

An experiment in emergent economics: 5-10 LLM-powered agents in a resource-limited world with no hard-coded economic rules.

## Hypothesis

LLM agents placed in resource-limited environments will spontaneously create markets, currencies, specialization, and institutions through natural language negotiation and planning.

## What We're Looking For

- Spontaneous adoption of informal currency
- Specialization into labor classes  
- Cooperative firms emerging
- Supply-demand stabilization
- Price convergence patterns
- Wealth inequality & economic cycles

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python run_dashboard.py --ticks 10000 --agents 100 --llm
```

Make sure to set your api key in .env

# About
I did use AI to generate the scaffolding for the project, I kinda wanted to have a nice research heavy project but didnt know how to structure for it. I wanted to make it winter themed but I already spent too much time on this and Im very tired so Ill do the theming and all my future changes next week. This is inspired by blackmirror thronglets episode!
