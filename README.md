# Thronglets

An experiment in emergent economics: 500-2000 LLM-powered agents in a resource-limited world with no hard-coded economic rules.

## Hypothesis

LLM agents placed in resource-limited environments will spontaneously create markets, currencies, specialization, and institutions through natural language negotiation and planning.

## What We're Looking For

- Spontaneous adoption of informal currency
- Specialization into labor classes  
- Cooperative firms emerging
- Supply-demand stabilization
- Price convergence patterns
- Wealth inequality & economic cycles

## Architecture

See `docs/architecture/` for detailed design docs.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Status

Phase 1: Core infrastructure in progress.
