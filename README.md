# Thronglets

LLM-powered agents in a resource-limited world with no hard-coded economic rules but they come up with an economy, hopefully?

## About

This project is inspired by the Black Mirror Thronglets episode! Watch the episode its soo good! 
Basically I've just defined rules for the world and some of the basic interactions (trading and making groups) and theres different personalities for the agents (leader, generalist, specialist, etc). All the main logic and "thinking" is an LLM that just gets the whole prompt and then decides what to do based on current inventory, memory, personality and reputation.

Read the [/docs](https://thronglets-seven.vercel.app/docs) for the complete knowledge.

# "whats the point"
why does there have to be a point? its just a simulation (of life) there's no rules (apart from world constraints), no controlling the agents, nothing. All you can do is observe...

# AI usage
I used AI for defining my idea a bit, just to make it a bittt more pointful but then the idea kinda flopped since we dont have the LLM resources to go that crazy (apparently i need to run hundreds of agents for thousands of ticks to prove emergent behavior) 
I also used AI for the initial project scaffolding and also for the frontend i wanted an exact replica of the black mirror sprites but am reallyy busy w exam work and already hit 10 hours so I just asked it to use emojis to quickly make the agents and places look nice.
Also the prompts used were improved by AI.
Docs I just typed it all out and told gpt to give me the html table 

Siege is finally over!
